# Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.
# Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:
# The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
# The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
# Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
# Function Description
# Complete the birthday function in the editor below.
# birthday has the following parameter(s):
# int s[n]: the numbers on each of the squares of chocolate
# int d: Ron's birth day
# int m: Ron's birth month
# Returns
# int: the number of ways the bar can be divided
